"""Single-backend reconciliation for the Tauri desktop sidecar.

The desktop shell starts the Python backend as a sidecar and kills it on a
graceful exit. But on a crash, OOM, force-quit, or ``SIGKILL`` the exit
handler never runs, so the backend is orphaned. The next launch then starts
a fresh backend on top of the orphan, and repeated cycles accumulate many
~500 MB backends (issue #5550).

Before a new backend binds its port it calls
:func:`reconcile_singleton_backend`, which terminates the backend recorded
by the previous launch (verified to actually be a Minions backend, to guard
against PID reuse) and then records its own PID. This makes "one desktop
backend at a time" hold even across abnormal termination.
