    Parameters
    ----------
    backup_id:
        ID of the backup to restore.
    req:
        Restore parameters (agents, config, secrets, global skills).
    stop_agent_fn:
        Async callable that stops a single agent by ID.  ``None`` when no
        ``MultiAgentManager`` is available (e.g. tests).
    stop_browsers_fn:
        Async callable that closes Minions-managed browser instances for the
        supplied workspace directories before those directories are restored.
        Browser profiles live inside workspaces and can keep Windows directory
        renames from succeeding. ``None`` when browser management is
        unavailable.
    preload_agent_fn:
        Async callable that preloads a single agent by ID after restore.
        ``None`` when no ``MultiAgentManager`` is available.
    list_running_agent_ids_fn:
        Sync callable that returns all currently running agent IDs.  Used to
        expand the stop set when ``include_secrets`` or
        ``include_global_skills`` is True, because those directories may contain
        files held open by any running agent (not only the restored ones).

    ------
    FileNotFoundError
        When the backup does not exist.
    Exception
