"""The structured ``recall_history`` recall tool.

The parameterized front door to durable history: ``expand`` / ``search`` /
``recall_tool`` cover the overwhelming share of recall calls, and none of
them needs model-authored code — each is a bound, read-only SQL query over
:class:`.memoryspace.MemorySpace`, executed in-process. That is why this tool
needs no sandbox and no approval (it is registered as an ``internal``
governance type): unlike ``recall_history_python`` there is nothing here the
model controls beyond scalar parameters, so there is nothing to isolate.

``recall_history_python`` remains the escape hatch for everything else
(sessions listing, custom SQL aggregation, scratch tables) — but it executes
model-authored Python and therefore requires the sandbox, which on platforms
without one (e.g. Windows sans WSL2) means per-call approval or refusal.
Fold stubs and the eviction index point at THIS tool first so the common
re-read path works everywhere.

_DOC = """Recall your recorded conversation history (raw turns) — structured.

Read back verbatim turns from the durable log: this session's turns that
scrolled out of context (seq spans come from the [context compressed] map)
plus your earlier sessions. Pick an op:

  • op="expand", lo=180, hi=184 — the full turns in the seq span [lo, hi],
    oldest first (one turn is lo == hi). The primary way to re-read what the
    eviction index or a [scroll folded] stub points you at.
  • op="search", query="flight number", k=10 — full-text search over your
    whole history (across your past sessions). Query with keywords, not full
    sentences (all terms must appear); use OR for alternatives and a generous
    k to cast a wide net: query="tank OR aquarium OR goldfish", k=20. Your
    current in-progress turn is never a hit — it is already in front of you.
    Optional: kind="model_turn"/"tool_result"; all_agents=true to span every
    agent; session_id/agent_id to pin a specific one (take precedence).
  • op="recall_tool", tool_call_id="call_abc" — a tool call and its result.

Rows come back with their seq so you can expand further. Commit an answer
only from FULL turn text (expand/search return it), never from a headline
alone. An empty result is stated explicitly and means the history genuinely
holds nothing for that span/query — differently-phrased searches are worth
one retry. For anything beyond these three reads (listing sessions, custom
SQL, counting/ranking), use a more advanced Python recall tool if one is
available to you.

Args:
    op (str): One of "expand", "search", "recall_tool".
    lo (int): expand only — first seq of the span.
    hi (int): expand only — last seq of the span.
    query (str): search only — keyword query (OR supported).
    k (int): search only — max hits to return (default 10).
    kind (str): search only — optional row-kind filter
        ("model_turn" / "tool_result").
    all_agents (bool): search only — span every agent's history.
    session_id (str): search only — pin one conversation
        (e.g. "cron:<job>").
    agent_id (str): search only — pin one agent's history.
    tool_call_id (str): recall_tool only — the tool call to re-read.
