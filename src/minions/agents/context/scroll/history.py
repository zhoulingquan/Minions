        computed and returned so a caller can preview the blast radius (pair
        with :meth:`estimate_purge` for the byte estimate). ``kinds`` narrows
        the delete to specific row kinds — e.g. ``("tool_result",)`` drops only
        tool output (the bulk of the bloat) while keeping the conversation
        turns. The FTS index is kept in sync (each purged row is removed from
        it first). Rows with a NULL/empty ``created_at`` are never matched, so
        they are retained. This is the retention/clear path — driven on
        startup and teardown by ``history_retention_days`` (default 30; set 0
        to keep history forever, which calls nothing here).

        Note: this DELETEs but does not ``VACUUM``, so freed pages are reused
        but the file does not shrink on disk until a separate vacuum.
