"""The sandboxed ``recall_history_python`` recall tool.

This is raw conversation-history recall — the agent's own recorded turns
across its sessions (verbatim). The model recalls history by running Python
here, not by scrolling back. Each call runs a fresh process (Option A:
stateless cells) inside the sandbox when a ``sandbox_config`` is supplied —
mirroring ``execute_shell_command``. The cell preamble builds ``ms`` (the
durable history ATTACHed read-only + a file-backed scratch DB) from
:mod:`.memoryspace`.

Python variables do not persist across calls; derived tables do, because the
``ms`` scratch DB is file-backed under the workspace.

_DOC = """Recall conversation history via Python — the ADVANCED recall tool.

For the common reads — re-expand a seq span, search by keywords, re-read one
tool call — prefer the simpler `recall_history` tool (op="expand"/"search"/
"recall_tool"): it needs no code and no sandbox. Reach for THIS Python REPL
when you need more than those three: listing/reading whole sessions, custom
SQL counting/ranking, scratch tables, or programmatically cross-referencing
many turns in one cell.

Read back the verbatim turns of your conversations from a durable log: this
session's turns that scrolled out of context (seq spans come from the
[context compressed] map) plus your earlier sessions. Usual flow: LOCATE a
seq — via the map or ms.search — then ms.expand(lo, hi) for the full turns
(one turn is ms.expand(seq, seq)). Commit an answer only from the FULL turn
text that ms.search / ms.expand return, never from a headline alone — the
answer is often buried late in a long, multi-topic turn.

`ms` is ALREADY DEFINED in this cell — use it directly. Do NOT `import ms`: it
is a ready-made object, not a module, and importing it raises
ModuleNotFoundError. Only what you print() is returned; variables do NOT
persist across calls, but scratch tables do.

    # scan hits by content (raw turns usually have NO headline), then re-read
    hits = ms.search("flight number", k=20)
    for r in hits:
        print(r["seq"], r["content"][:1000])
    print(ms.expand(180, 184))   # full turns once you have the seq span

Every helper returns a LIST OF DICTS (rows). Each helper's output schema is its
`Row: {…}` line below — those are the EXACT dict keys you index by (there is no
`content_preview`: the text key is always `content`, and only `search` carries
`session_id`). Don't assume a key; print(rows[0].keys()) if unsure. On overflow
the row helpers append a trailing {"_truncated": True} row (search is capped by
k instead) — narrow your span if you see it.

The persistent record reaches you through `ms`. Prefer these intent helpers
(values are bound for you — no SQL to write):
  • ms.expand(lo, hi) — full turns in the seq span [lo, hi], oldest first.
    Row: {seq, kind, role, name, content, headline}.
  • ms.recall_tool(tool_call_id) — a tool call and its result (this agent;
    pass all_agents=True to widen). Row: {seq, kind, role, name, tool_input,
    tool_state, content}.
  • ms.search(query, all_agents=False, kind=None, k=10) — FTS5. By default
    searches your whole history across past sessions; all_agents=True spans
    every agent here. Pin a specific one with session_id="cron:<job>" /
    agent_id="<other>" (these take precedence). kind filters by row kind
    ("model_turn" / "tool_result"). Row: {seq, session_id, kind, role, name,
    headline, content (full turn)}. Query with keywords, not full sentences
    (all terms must appear); use OR-sets for alternatives and a generous k to
    cast a wide net: ms.search("tank OR aquarium OR goldfish", k=20). Your
    current in-progress turn is never a hit — it is already in front of you.
  • ms.sessions() — your past conversations (incl. scheduled cron/heartbeat
    runs); ms.session(session_id, all_agents=False) reads one in full, scoped
    to you by default. ms.agents() lists agents.
  • ms.days_between(d1, d2, inclusive=False) — |days| between two dates
    (parses a date out of either string); use it instead of hand math.
Advanced escape hatch: ms.sql_query(sql, params) reads arbitrary SQL over the
read-only `hist.conversation_history` (for custom counting/ranking) and
ms.sql_exec(sql, params) writes a `main` scratch DB. Bind via params, never
f-string values in.

ANSWERING FROM RECALL — once you've pulled the turns:
  • "How many / list all": the evidence is usually spread across SESSIONS —
    find them ALL (several searches / angles), then count DISTINCT items the
    user actually DID — not mentions (the same thing said 3× is one), and not
    things merely planned/considered or that you (the assistant) suggested.
  • A fact that CHANGED over time: the most recent one (by date) is the current
    answer and supersedes earlier values — give the latest, don't report a
    stale one or stack both.
  • "When / how long between": read each relevant turn's date (turns carry a
    date), anchor relative phrases ("last Tuesday", "two months ago") to THAT
    turn's date, and use ms.days_between — never do calendar math by hand.
  • What the USER did, owns, or prefers comes from the USER's own turns, not
    from suggestions you (the assistant) offered.
  • CONNECT facts: linking two stated facts to reach a third is valid reading,
    not fabrication. But COMMIT only to the EXACT thing asked — a near-relative
    does not count ("Sales Engineer" != "Sales Manager").
  • Don't refuse after one empty query — try a differently-phrased search
    first; abstain only when the history genuinely holds nothing.

    source (str): Python source to execute.
