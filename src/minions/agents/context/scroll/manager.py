"""ScrollContextManager — write-through + eviction-index context management.

The strategy form of the design in ``CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.html``: instead of
subclassing the agent, it is injected into :class:`MinionsAgent` and drives the
two delegated hooks.

* :meth:`on_save` — every live turn is persisted to the durable
  ``conversation_history`` as it enters the window (write-through).
* :meth:`compress` — past the token threshold, keep the recent tail (and the
  active turn) and fold the evicted middle into an in-context
  :class:`EvictionIndex`. No
  summarization, nothing lost — every node points to a ``seq`` span recallable
  via the structured ``recall_history`` tool (or the sandboxed
  ``recall_history_python`` REPL).
