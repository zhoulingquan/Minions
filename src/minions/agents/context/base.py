"""The pluggable context-manager interface.

A ``ContextManager`` is an injectable strategy that owns an agent's context
management. :class:`~minions.agents.react_agent.MinionsAgent` delegates its two
AgentScope hooks to it:

* ``_save_to_context`` -> :meth:`on_save` (after the base append)
* ``compress_context`` -> :meth:`compress` (instead of the base compression)

When no manager is injected, the agent keeps its native AgentScope behavior —
so a strategy is purely additive and fully opt-in.
