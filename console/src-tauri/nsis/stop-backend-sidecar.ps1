# Stop Minions backend / bundled CLI processes launched from *this* install
# directory so the installer can overwrite their files. A leftover backend
# (possibly orphaned, issue #5550) keeps its PyInstaller ".pyd" modules
# memory-mapped, which locks them on Windows; the installer then fails to
# overwrite those files and shows the cryptic native "can't write file" dialog.
#
# Scoping to $InstallDir leaves a coexisting Minions install untouched.
#
# Must stay ConstrainedLanguage-safe (WDAC/AppLocker): use only cmdlets,
# operators and core string methods -- never [System.*] static calls, which
# throw under ConstrainedLanguage mode and made the previous helper give up
# silently without stopping anything.
#
# Exit 0 when no scoped backend remains, 1 while one is still running.
