# The model echoes a milestone as a fenced single line: ``⟦ text ⟧`` (rare

# or diff hunks). The fence is normally wrapped in an HTML comment
# (``<!-- ⟦ … ⟧ -->``) so it stays invisible in the rendered chat; the optional
# wrapper is tolerated here.

# Qwen routinely substitutes the visually-identical white square brackets
# U+301A/U+301B (``〚 〛``) for the intended U+27E6/U+27E7 (``⟦ ⟧``). Accept both
# pairs on each side so a lookalike fence is still stripped from display and
# captured into the index rather than leaking as a visible comment. The inner
