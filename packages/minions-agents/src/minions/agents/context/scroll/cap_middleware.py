    After a tool produces its final ``ToolResponse``, if the flattened text
    exceeds ``token_cap`` (the model's own estimator), the *full* output is
    written through to ``conversation_history`` and the in-context content is
    replaced by a token-bounded preview plus a recall pointer keyed by
    ``tool_call_id``. AgentScope's own truncation is disabled upstream, so this
    is the only capping path and it never loses data.
