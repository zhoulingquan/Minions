"""Pluggable context-management strategies.

The default agent behavior is AgentScope-native compression; injecting a
:class:`ContextManager` replaces it. The only built-in alternative today is the
*scroll* strategy (durable ``history.db`` + an in-context eviction index + a
sandboxed ``recall_history_python`` recall REPL), selected via
``LightContextConfig.strategy == "scroll"``.

:func:`build_scroll_components` is the single entry point the builder calls; it
returns ``None`` for any non-scroll strategy, so the feature is fully opt-in.
