"""The builder's two scroll recall gates.

``_scroll_recall_runnable`` — whether scroll is wired at all. The sandboxed
``recall_history_python`` REPL fails closed without a ``sandbox_config`` (the
governor injects it); the structured ``recall_history`` tool runs in-process
but with no governor the guard layer itself is degraded. So the gate stays
conservative: governor absent and ``allow_unsandboxed`` off → degrade to
native context management rather than evict history nothing can read back.

``_scroll_repl_runnable`` — the narrower gate applied once scroll IS wired:
whether to ALSO offer the Python REPL. It is registered only when a sandbox
actually exists (governor present AND its probe found one) or unsandboxed
recall is explicitly opted in. Otherwise it is omitted — on a no-sandbox
platform it would only fail-closed into a recurring approval prompt — and the
model recalls through the structured ``recall_history`` tool, which needs no
sandbox.
