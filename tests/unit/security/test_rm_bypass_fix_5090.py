"""Focused regression test for #5090: rm -rf ${HOME} bypass.

The root cause: ``_RM_ESCAPE_PATTERNS`` applied a ``${VAR}`` blanking
substitution to the rm-part used for shlex tokenisation, which erased
real targets like ``${HOME}`` before path expansion — so the guard saw
no target and did not flag ``rm -rf ${HOME}`` as outside-workspace.

The fix splits escape patterns into:
- ``_RM_ESCAPE_PATTERNS`` (extraction, real targets preserved)
- ``_RM_DETECTION_ONLY_PATTERNS`` (detection, ${VAR} blanked to
  detect things like ``${RM}`` but NOT applied to extraction)
